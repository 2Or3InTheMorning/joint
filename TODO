- add zoom capabilities to diagrams, new module Joint.dia.layer, 
  which can also implement other stuff, e.g. selections, even
   rotations, ...
- implement Element>>removeJoints() method which removes all associated
   joints
- implement Joint>>remove() method
- implement Joint>>connect() method to connect joint programmaticaly
   to an arbitrary object in the paper
- note that Joint>>connect(), together with pattern:
 ([aggregate.wrapper].concat(aggregate.inner)).forEach(function(e){
   e.animate({translation: "-200 -100"}, 3000); })
  (implement animate method on Elements?) will allow to programmaticaly
  create animations (videos) of diagram creation!
   => interesting would be to describe those animations
   in JSON format together with diagrams, that would open a
   possibility to have records of diagram transformations stored
   as a string that can be playable. Another challenge would
   be to have "record" functionality so that from one moment
   in time all changes made by user would be stored as either a
   sequence of diffs or entire snapshots.
